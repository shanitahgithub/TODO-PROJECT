The JavaScript code in my project defines functions to manage tasks in my todo list. 
let tasks = []; This line declares an empty array called tasks, which will store the tasks for my todo list.

function renderTasks() {
  const taskList = document.getElementById("taskList");
  taskList.innerHTML = "";
  tasks.forEach((task, index) => {
    // Create elements for each task
  });
}   ,This function renderTasks() is responsible for rendering the tasks on the webpage. It clears the existing task list and then iterates over each task in the tasks array, 
creating HTML elements to display them.

function addTask() {
  // Function to add a new task
} ,This function addTask() is called when the user clicks the "Add" button. It retrieves the task input from the HTML, adds it to the tasks array, clears the input field,
and then calls renderTasks() to update the displayed tasks.

function editTask(index) {
  // Function to edit an existing task
}   ,This function editTask(index) is called when the user clicks the edit button for a task. It prompts the user to enter a new name for the task, updates the task name in
the tasks array, and then calls renderTasks() to update the displayed tasks.

function deleteTask(index) {
  // Function to delete an existing task
}  ,This function deleteTask(index) is called when the user clicks the delete button for a task. It prompts the user to confirm the deletion, removes the task from the tasks array
if confirmed, and then calls renderTasks() to update the displayed tasks

function toggleCompleted(index) {
  // Function to toggle the completion status of a task
}  ,This function toggleCompleted(index) is called when the user checks or unchecks the checkbox for a task. It toggles the completion status of the task in the tasks array and 
then calls renderTasks() to update the displayed tasks.

renderTasks(); ,,,This line calls renderTasks() once when the page loads, ensuring that the initial tasks are displayed on the webpage.
In summary, this JavaScript code provides functionality to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed in a todo list.
The renderTasks() function ensures that the tasks are displayed on the webpage and updated dynamically as the user interacts with the todo list.
